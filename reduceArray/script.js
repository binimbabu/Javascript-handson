//The code uses the reduce method on the array [1, 2, 3] to sum its elements. It takes two parameters, a (accumulator) and b (current value), adding them together. The final result 6 is printed to the console, representing the total of the array's numbers.
console.log([1, 2, 3].reduce((a, b) => a + b));
